ABANDONED! :-(
Error checking remained too damn hard and it was easier to add better hinting to assist human-cleaning on a spreadsheet.
The next addition should be to start with a user-provided list of series, then go look for them in each of the sheets in an interactive manner and ask users when there is doubt.
This would make more sense than the current model, which looks for everything - which is resulting in a lot of false positives and clashes.
